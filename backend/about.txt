==About Me==
 I'm John Du, senior at Purdue University majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering and Security. I like to think of myself as a creator. Code is just another way to create great things. It's why I make pixel art. It's why I develop games in my spare time. It's why I love doing what I do. 
 If you want to commission pixel art, contact me by email and we can discuss the details.
